# reinforcement-learning
My AI projects using reinforcement learning:
- `smartcab` -- application of Q-learning to train a hypothetical self-driving car by trial and error;
- `gridworld` -- the canonical MDP example of robot navigating in a grid world [To be added];
- `blackblox` -- the mysterious Blackbox ML challenge [To be added].
