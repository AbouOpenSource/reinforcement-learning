# Train a Smartcab How to Drive

## Synopsis
Smartcab is a self-driving car from the not-so-distant future that ferries people from one arbitrary location to another. This application demonstrates how to use model-free **reinforcement learning** (i.e., Q-learning) to train smartcabs to desired self-driving behaviors through trials and errors.
