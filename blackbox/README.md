# The Blackbox Challenge

## Synopsis
One needs to program a learning agent that can play a mysterious game with *unknown* rules. At each time step, the agent is given an environment state vector and has a few possible actions to perform. The rewards may be delayed and have *stochastic* nature -- the same action may yield different reward values.
